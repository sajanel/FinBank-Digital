        </div>
        <div class=""content_section_text"">
          <p>
                Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href=""/manual"">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled

                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

credentials. No issues were reported with access, privilege, or
intermittent failure.","Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the
remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands on localhost.

dsa-5586 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol suite.
    CVE-2021-41617 It was discovered that sshd failed to correctly initialise supplemental groups when
    executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the command as a different user. Instead
    these commands would inherit the groups that sshd was started with. CVE-2023-28531 Luci Stanescu reported
    that a error prevented constraints being communicated to the ssh-agent when adding smartcard keys to the
    agent with per-hop destination constraints, resulting in keys being added without constraints.
    CVE-2023-48795 Fabian Baeumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Joerg Schwenk discovered that the SSH protocol is
    prone to a prefix truncation attack, known as the Terrapin attack. This attack allows a MITM attacker to
    effect a limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra
    messages prior to the commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages
    immediately after encryption starts. Details can be found at https://terrapin-attack.com/ CVE-2023-51384
    It was discovered that when PKCS#11-hosted private keys were added while specifying destination
    constraints, if the PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints
    applied. CVE-2023-51385 It was discovered that if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
    metacharacters was passed to ssh, and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate
    referenced the user or hostname via expansion tokens, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary
    user/hostnames to ssh could potentially perform command injection. The situation could arise in case of
    git repositories with submodules, where the repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in
    its user or hostname. For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in version
    1:8.4p1-5+deb11u3. For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in version
    1:9.2p1-2+deb12u2. We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages. For the detailed security status
    of openssh please refer to its security tracker page at: https://security-

dsa-5586 advisory.

    Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol suite.
    CVE-2021-41617 It was discovered that sshd failed to correctly initialise supplemental groups when
    executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the command as a different user. Instead
    these commands would inherit the groups that sshd was started with. CVE-2023-28531 Luci Stanescu reported
    that a error prevented constraints being communicated to the ssh-agent when adding smartcard keys to the
    agent with per-hop destination constraints, resulting in keys being added without constraints.
    CVE-2023-48795 Fabian Baeumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Joerg Schwenk discovered that the SSH protocol is
    prone to a prefix truncation attack, known as the Terrapin attack. This attack allows a MITM attacker to
    effect a limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra
    messages prior to the commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages
    immediately after encryption starts. Details can be found at https://terrapin-attack.com/ CVE-2023-51384
    It was discovered that when PKCS#11-hosted private keys were added while specifying destination
    constraints, if the PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints
    applied. CVE-2023-51385 It was discovered that if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
    metacharacters was passed to ssh, and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate
    referenced the user or hostname via expansion tokens, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary
    user/hostnames to ssh could potentially perform command injection. The situation could arise in case of
    git repositories with submodules, where the repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in
    its user or hostname. For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in version
    1:8.4p1-5+deb11u3. For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in version

  - The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity is overly high.
    It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive
    CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative
    servers and recursive resolvers. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through
    9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1
    through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-4408)

  - Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the
    KeyTrap issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the
    protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG
    records. (CVE-2023-50387)

  - The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped)
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC
    responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the NSEC3 issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an
    algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations. (CVE-2023-50868)

  - A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when: -
    `nxdomain-redirect <domain>;` is configured, and - the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918
    address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response. This issue affects BIND 9
    versions 9.12.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.8-S1 through
    9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-5517)

  - A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale may cause `named` to crash with an assertion failure
    during recursive resolution, when both of these features are enabled. This issue affects BIND 9 versions
    9.16.12 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.45-S1,
    and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-5679)

  - To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to
    clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of
    memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later

  - The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity is overly high.
    It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive
    CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative
    servers and recursive resolvers. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through
    9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1
    through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-4408)

  - Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the
    KeyTrap issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the
    protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG
    records. (CVE-2023-50387)

  - The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped)
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC
    responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the NSEC3 issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an
    algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations. (CVE-2023-50868)

  - A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when: -
    `nxdomain-redirect <domain>;` is configured, and - the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918
    address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response. This issue affects BIND 9
    versions 9.12.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.8-S1 through
    9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-5517)

  - A bad interaction between DNS64 and serve-stale may cause `named` to crash with an assertion failure
    during recursive resolution, when both of these features are enabled. This issue affects BIND 9 versions
    9.16.12 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.45-S1,
    and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-5679)

  - To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to
    clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of
    memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later
    processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering

    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-24806
    Debian Bug     : 1063484

    It was discovered that the uv_getaddrinfo() function in libuv, an
    asynchronous event notification library, incorrectly truncated certain
    hostnames, which may result in bypass of security measures on internal
    APIs or SSRF attacks.

    For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
    in version 1.40.0-2+deb11u1.

    For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
    version 1.44.2-1+deb12u1.

    We recommend that you upgrade your libuv1 packages.

    Alicia Boya Garcia reported that the GDBus signal subscriptions in the

    Package        : openssh
    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-6387

    The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) discovered that OpenSSH, an
    implementation of the SSH protocol suite, is prone to a signal handler
    race condition. If a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime
    seconds (120 by default), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called
    asynchronously and calls various functions that are not
    async-signal-safe. A remote unauthenticated attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This flaw
    affects sshd in its default configuration.

    Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
    https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt

    For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
    implementation, which may result in denial of service.

    To mitigate CVE-2024-1737 two new configuration statements have been
    added to allow operators of secondary servers and recursive resolvers to
    set an upper bound on the growth of data in their zones or caches.
    Details can be found at:
    https://kb.isc.org/docs/rrset-limits-in-zones

    For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been
    fixed in version 1:9.16.50-1~deb11u1. For the oldstable distribution
    (bullseye) the limits to mitigate CVE-2024-1737 are hardcoded and not
    configurable.

    For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
    version 1:9.18.28-1~deb12u1.

                     CVE-2024-12088 CVE-2024-12747

    The update for rsync announced in DSA 5843-1 introduced a regression
    when using the -H option to preserve hard links. Updated packages are
    now available to correct this issue.

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in rsync, a fast, versatile,
    remote (and local) file-copying tool.

    CVE-2024-12084

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman discovered a
        heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to improper handling of
        attacker-controlled checksum lengths. A remote attacker can take
        advantage of this flaw for code execution.

    CVE-2024-12085

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman reported a flaw in
        the way rsync compares file checksums, allowing a remote attacker to
        trigger an information leak.

    CVE-2024-12086

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman discovered a flaw
        which would result in a server leaking contents of an arbitrary file
        from the client's machine.

    CVE-2024-12087

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman reported a path
        traversal vulnerability in the rsync daemon affecting the
        --inc-recursive option, which could allow a server to write files
        outside of the client's intended destination directory.

    CVE-2024-12088

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman reported that when
        using the --safe-links option, rsync fails to properly verify if a
        symbolic link destination contains another symbolic link with it,
        resulting in path traversal and arbitrary file write outside of the
        desired directory.

    CVE-2024-12747

        Aleksei Gorban loqpa discovered a race condition when handling
        symbolic links resulting in an information leak which may enable
        escalation of privileges.

    For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in

    Package        : rsync
    Debian Bug     : 1093052 1093089
    CVE ID         : CVE-2024-12084 CVE-2024-12085 CVE-2024-12086 CVE-2024-12087
                     CVE-2024-12088 CVE-2024-12747

    The update for rsync announced in DSA 5843-1 introduced a regression
    when using the -H option to preserve hard links. Updated packages are
    now available to correct this issue.

    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in rsync, a fast, versatile,
    remote (and local) file-copying tool.

    CVE-2024-12084

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman discovered a
        heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to improper handling of
        attacker-controlled checksum lengths. A remote attacker can take
        advantage of this flaw for code execution.

    CVE-2024-12085

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman reported a flaw in
        the way rsync compares file checksums, allowing a remote attacker to
        trigger an information leak.

    CVE-2024-12086

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman discovered a flaw
        which would result in a server leaking contents of an arbitrary file
        from the client's machine.

    CVE-2024-12087

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman reported a path
        traversal vulnerability in the rsync daemon affecting the
        --inc-recursive option, which could allow a server to write files
        outside of the client's intended destination directory.

    CVE-2024-12088

        Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos and Jasiel Spelman reported that when
        using the --safe-links option, rsync fails to properly verify if a
        symbolic link destination contains another symbolic link with it,
        resulting in path traversal and arbitrary file write outside of the
        desired directory.

    CVE-2024-12747

        Aleksei Gorban loqpa discovered a race condition when handling
        symbolic links resulting in an information leak which may enable
        escalation of privileges.

    For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
    version 3.2.7-1+deb12u2.

    We recommend that you upgrade your rsync packages.

    Package        : openssh
    CVE ID         : CVE-2025-26465

    The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) discovered that the OpenSSH client
    is vulnerable to a machine-in-the-middle attack if the VerifyHostKeyDNS
    option is enabled (disabled by default).

    Details can be found in the Qualys advisory at
    https://www.qualys.com/2025/02/18/openssh-mitm-dos.txt

    For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
    version 1:9.2p1-2+deb12u5.

    We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

    For the detailed security status of openssh please refer to its security
    tracker page at:
    https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssh

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

Note that the plugin output is only informational and does not
necessarily indicate the presence of any security vulnerabilities.","n/a","http://www.nessus.org/u?d9c03a9a

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","SSH was detected on port 22 but no credentials were provided.
